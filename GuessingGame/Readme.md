# Number Guessing Game in C

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in C as part of my programming practice.

## Description

The program generates a random number within a specified range, then prompts the user to guess the number. 
It gives feedback on whether each guess is too high or too low, until the user guesses correctly. 

This project demonstrates basic C programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input/output, and random number generation.

## How to Build and Run

1. Compile the program with:gcc GuessingGame.c -o GuessingGame.exe

2. Run the executable:./GuessingGame.exe

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game by entering your guesses.

## Learning Outcomes

- Using random number generation in C.
- Working with user input and output.
- Applying control flow and loop constructs.
- Basic game logic development.





Feel free to try the game and share feedback or improvements!
