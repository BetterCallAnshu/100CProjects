# Simple Calculator Learning Project

This contains a simple calculator program written in C as part of my learning journey in programming. 
It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using functions split across multiple files.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: The main program that takes input from the user and displays results using calculator functions.
- `MyCalculator.h`: Header file declaring the calculator function prototypes.
- `MyCalculator.c`: Implementation of calculator functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations for two 32-bit integers.
- Safe handling of division and modulus by zero with user-friendly error messages.
- Modular programming using header and source files for clear organization.

## How to Build and Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Compile the program with:

3. Run the executable:

4. Input two integers when prompted to see the results of various operations.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice with C programming syntax and function declarations/definitions.
- Understanding of header files and source files separation.
- Basics of command-line compilation and linking with multiple source files.
- Handling input/output and simple error checking.
